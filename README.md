# 🐌 LeetCode Snail's Slow and Steady Coding Journey 🐌

Welcome to the LeetCode Snail repository, where we embrace the art of slow coding and steady problem-solving! 🐌✨

## 📚 What is this?

This isn’t just another coding repository; it’s a delightful expedition through the world of LeetCode, where every solution is crafted with the patience of a snail on a leisurely stroll.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the Repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leet-code-snail.git
```

2. Open the Files: Like opening a treasure chest, but with fewer jewels and more code.

3. Solve Problems: Because who doesn’t love a good brain workout? (No gym membership required!)

## 🐌 Why LeetCode?

Practice Makes Perfect: Just like a snail learns to navigate, you’ll learn to code.
Interview Prep: Because “What’s your greatest weakness?” is easier to answer when you can solve a binary tree problem.
Fun: Coding is serious business, but who says we can’t have a laugh?

## 🤖 Solutions

Easy Problems: For those days when you feel like a coding genius.
Medium Problems: For when you want to feel smart but also slightly confused.
Hard Problems: For when you want to question your life choices.

## 🎉 Contributing

Want to join the fun? Here’s how:

1. Fork the repo (like a snail forks its lettuce).

2. Create a new branch (because branches are where the fun happens).

3. Make your changes and commit them (like a snail committing to a new path).

4. Push to the branch and create a pull request!

## 🤔 FAQ

#### Q: Why snails?
